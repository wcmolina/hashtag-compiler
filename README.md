# Hashtag Compiler
Project done for Compilers phase 2. This `branch` contains the lexical, syntactic and semantic analysis, as well as some intermediate
code generation (incomplete).

Project created using IntelliJ IDEA as our development environment and Java 8 (1.8) as the programming language of choice. Opening the project
from the source code in this branch should work just fine in IntelliJ. This `branch` contains the latest version of the project.

## Whats missing
Intermediate code for:
* Switch statements
* Function calls
* Functions

Type checking for:
* Functions with return type must have a return statement

Grammar:
* Arithmetic expressions need to accept functions calls

And obviously final code generation, but the code (draft) for that is in another project.
